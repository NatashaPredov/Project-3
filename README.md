## Project 3

# Project Proposal 
- extending off of https://github.com/NatashaPredov/Project-2 and https://github.com/NatashaPredov/Project-1-
- using of 3 years of data to build the model
- Feature engineering to try to add 3 to 5 vars. Previously used % change, for this project we will be trying to add new vars (David assistance here): require a list of 5 vars and how to calculate them
- look 10 business days in the future to determine if we are confidnet that the trend for the next two weeks are up (= long trade), down (= short trade), flat 
- to emulate trading security multiple times within a business week 
- This would help to monitor the trade moving forward 

# Scope
1. Metrics for Feature engineering: std dev, average price as determined by the avg open/close high/low or all four
2. Modeling: Pycarrot, Neural Network 
3. ROI: determine trend (up/down/flat)
